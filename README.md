# 4681 Training Wheels
**This code was written for Murphy's Law but is applicable to all teams. If you are looking for guidance, go ahead and take a look**


- Within this repository you will find examples of most of the different classes we have had to use over the years as well as a couple examples. A few things to remember, these are just one way of doing things. One of the best things about programming is there are infinitely many ways of achieving a task. So if you have a better idea, by all means, use that one. In addition, the code listed in here is a skeleton of a program that shows how something would work. That being said, I do not recommend deploying it to a robot as most of the things it is looking for will not actually be plugged in and all of the port numbers are completely arbitary.
