//IMPORTANT NOTE: Lidar is accurate within an inch or two on average from wherever it is pointing at,
//HOWEVER, You will experience much better results if you were to take the distance every half second and average
//This average distance would be better at eliminating the standard deviation of periods
//In addition, remember the laser beam is a straight line, so if the lidar isn't level, neither will the laser, and then your distance will be asked
//Also, do not put a method of drive until getDistance() < 50, etc because if a robot drives in front, then your distance and massively skewed
